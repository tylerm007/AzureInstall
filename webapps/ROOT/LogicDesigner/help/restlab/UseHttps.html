<h5>Use HTTPS</h5>
If you select this checkbox, the URL will change to have 'https'
as the protocol.  Unselecting, will replace 'https:' with 'http:'
<p/>
If the project setting of HTTPS Only is true, you must select this
or you will get the expected error that the project only accepts
HTTPS requests.
<p/>
Note that, if you are accessing Logic Designer over HTTPS, this
<b>must</b> be set to true.
