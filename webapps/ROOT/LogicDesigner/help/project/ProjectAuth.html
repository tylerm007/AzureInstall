<h5>Project authentication provider</h5>

The REST API for your project is always accessed using an API key. But often you may want users to use
a name/password combination to authenticate.
<p/>
Espresso Logic includes a mechanism for defining users and passwords, and a service (using REST, of course)
to convert a set of credentials (typically user name and password) into a usable API key.
<p/>
If you need such a service, you should choose the <em>Built-in authentication</em> option. If you
expect to use API keys directly, you can leave this blank.
