<h5>Default Response Format</h5>
The default format for responses. If this option is null, or has the value "json",
then the standard JSON format will be used.
<p/>
If the value for this option is "jsonObject", then the JSON will be structured
differently: the response will be one object with a array of objects and (usually)
some extra metadata.
