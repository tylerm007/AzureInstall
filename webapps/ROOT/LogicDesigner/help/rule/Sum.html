<h4>Sum</h4>

<br><a href="http://docs.espressologic.com/docs/logic-designer/business-logic/sum" target="_blank"><strong>Sums</strong></a>
 declares a Parent attribute to be maintained as the sum of a designated child role's summed attribute, with an optional qualification to filter child objects.   Parent reference names are derived from Foreign Key Relationships.
<br/><br/>

For example, to derive the balance as the sum of the unshipped orders:<br/><br/>

<code>Derive balance as <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum(purchaseorderList.amount_total <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where null === ShippedDate)</code>
<br/><br/>

<li>Efficient - parent data is adjusted via a 1 row update - the system does not issue a select sum() SQL command</li>
