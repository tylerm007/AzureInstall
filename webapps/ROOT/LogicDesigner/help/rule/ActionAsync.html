<h5>Asynchronous action</h5>
If this option is checked, this action will execute asynchronously, independently of the current transaction. 
Whether it succeeds or fails will not affect the current transaction.
<p/>
This can be helpful for things that may take a long time, such as making an external call, sending an email, etc...
